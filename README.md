For this course, we'll build a financial dashboard that has:
A public home page.
A login page.
Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up in a later chapter.

By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.
